# Filter-characterization
Functions to characterize optical filters 

1. Filters with one peak
2. Filters with broad spectrum
3. Filters with multiple peaks

I wrote this code for my lab "astronomical instrumentation at the optical table" where I used a spectrometer to take spectra of multiple filters and had to characterize them.
